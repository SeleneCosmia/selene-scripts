#### Welcome to my bash stash

Here you'll find the majority of my scripts/commands for the most part they are mostly eyecandy,
with a few more useful utils like my customized completions for commands I use often like [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org) and [gradient](https://crates.io/crates/gradient).
